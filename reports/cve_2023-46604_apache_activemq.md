# Vulnerability Report: CVE 2023-46604 Apache ActiveMQ

## Description
CVE 2023-46604 is a critical vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ, categorized as a Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw. It allows remote attackers with network access to a broker to execute arbitrary shell commands by exploiting serialized class types within the OpenWire protocol. This vulnerability poses severe risks as it can be used to install ransomware binaries on compromised devices, potentially extorting targeted organizations. The vulnerability is associated with the HelloKitty ransomware operators based on the ransom note and evidence obtained from the investigation.

## Vulnerability Details
CVE 2023-46604 is a critical vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ that allows remote attackers with network access to a broker to execute arbitrary shell commands. The vulnerability is categorized as a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. The root cause of this vulnerability is the deserialization of untrusted data. It is achieved by exploiting serialized class types within the OpenWire protocol, which allows the broker to instantiate any class available on the classpath.

The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 100, indicating its severity. Attackers have attempted to exploit this vulnerability to install ransomware binaries on compromised devices, with the intention of extorting targeted organizations. The malicious activity has been linked to the HelloKitty ransomware operators based on the ransom note and evidence gathered during the investigation.

## Affected Products and Impact
The versions of Apache ActiveMQ and Legacy OpenWire Module affected by CVE 2023-46604 are as follows:
- Apache ActiveMQ versions before 5.15.16
- Legacy OpenWire Module versions before 5.15.16

The impact or criticality of the CVE 2023-46604 Apache ActiveMQ vulnerability is categorized as critical. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands, potentially compromising the affected system. The vulnerability can be exploited for remote code execution, posing severe risks to compromised users.

## Vulnerability Identifiers
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID associated with this CVE 2023-46604 Apache ActiveMQ vulnerability is CVE202346604.

## Threat Actors Using the Vulnerability
Exploitation activity related to CVE 2023-46604 has been detected by Rapid7 in two customer environments. The threat actors targeted outdated versions of Apache ActiveMQ and attempted to deploy ransomware. In one incident, multiple unsuccessful attempts were made to encrypt victim assets. The activity has been attributed to the HelloKitty ransomware family, whose source code was leaked in early October.

## Exploitation Details
The trigger for CVE 2023-46604 Apache ActiveMQ vulnerability is the exploitation of serialized class types within the OpenWire protocol. This allows remote attackers with network access to a broker to execute arbitrary shell commands. By abusing serialized class types, the broker can instantiate any class available on the classpath, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

The CVE 2023-46604 Apache ActiveMQ vulnerability can be triggered remotely. Attackers with network access to a broker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary shell commands by manipulating serialized class types in the OpenWire protocol. The attack delivery method mentioned in the information is the exploitation of the vulnerability to deliver ransomware by loading remote binaries.

## Mitigations
It is recommended to take the following mitigations to address the CVE 2023-46604 Apache ActiveMQ vulnerability:

1. Patch Systems: Immediately patch systems running Apache ActiveMQ with the available patches for versions 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, and 5.18.3. These patches address the CVE 2023-46604 vulnerability.

2. Determine ActiveMQ Version: Use the command "activemq version" to determine the version of ActiveMQ running. This will help identify if a vulnerable version is in use.

3. Monitor Vendor Patch Advisories: Stay updated on software vendor advisories related to CVE 2023-46604. Apply any security updates promptly as vendors patch their products.

4. Limit Access to Systems: If unable to immediately patch the systems, block them from being accessible from the internet. This will significantly reduce the attack surface and minimize the risk of exploitation.

## Recommendations
Based on the available information, here are the recommendations for addressing the CVE 2023-46604 Apache ActiveMQ vulnerability:

1. Closely monitor software vendor advisories: Stay updated with the latest security updates and patches released by the software vendors. Monitor their advisories specifically related to CVE 2023-46604.

2. Apply the official security updates promptly: Once the software vendors release the security updates to address CVE 2023-46604, ensure that you apply the updates promptly to your environment.

3. Check your ActiveMQ version: Determine the version of ActiveMQ you are running by using the command "activemq version". This will help you identify if you are using a vulnerable version.

4. Upgrade ActiveMQ to a fixed release: If you are running a vulnerable version, upgrade your ActiveMQ installation to a fixed release that addresses CVE 2023-46604.

5. Look for signs of compromise: After upgrading, monitor your environment for any signs of compromise. Refer to Rapid7 and Huntress for details about the attackers' behavior and indicators of compromise.

6. Block systems from Internet access if unable to patch: If you are unable to patch the systems immediately, it is recommended to block them from being accessible from the Internet. This will help limit the attack surface.

Please note that these recommendations are based on the available information and may be subject to change as new information and patches become available. It is important to stay updated and follow the recommendations provided by software vendors and security advisories.

## Short-term and Long-term Strategies
Based on the available information, the short-term actions that can be taken to secure systems against the CVE 2023-46604 Apache ActiveMQ vulnerability are:

1. Patch Systems: Immediately patch the systems running Apache ActiveMQ with the available patches for versions 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, and 5.18.3.

2. Determine ActiveMQ Version: Use the command "activemq version" to determine the version of ActiveMQ running. This will help identify if a vulnerable version is in use.

3. Monitor Vendor Patch Advisories: Stay updated on software vendor advisories related to CVE 2023-46604. Apply any security updates promptly as vendors patch their products.

4. Limit Access to Systems: If unable to immediately patch the systems, block them from being accessible from the internet. This will significantly reduce the attack surface and minimize the risk of exploitation.

The long-term strategies for enhancing the security posture and preventing CVE 2023-46604 Apache ActiveMQ vulnerabilities are not explicitly mentioned in the available information.
